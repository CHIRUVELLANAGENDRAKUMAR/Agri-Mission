# Agri-Mission-GREEN-TECHNOLOGY
Observe the Atmosphere for using the Electrical Mission and supply the Water to Trees automatically  
PROJECT ON GREEN TECHNOLOGY
	
“Energy Absorption from the Atmosphere by using Electrical sensors and using for the Cultivation”
•	It works without the help of humans, automatically it works.
•	Saving the electrical city, natural power is supplying.
•	Water should not be wastage while supplying through pipelines likes as drip irrigation system.
•	The plant will grow by supplying the sufficient water based on the temperature conditions (particular land).
•	Humans didn’t get more strain.
•	It is very useful for farmers in the fields
